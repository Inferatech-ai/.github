 # Ineferatech AI

**Inference-first. Infrastructure-free. Precision at scale.**

Inferatech AI is a next-generation inference orchestration platform designed for model developers and ML engineers who require secure, low-latency, and usage-based inference on custom LLMs. Upload your trained language models and leverage our token-metered API layer to run inference in our secure, isolated compute environments.
---

## 🧠 What We Do

Inferatech AI bridges the gap between custom language model development and real-world inference. While most AI platforms focus on hosting, serving, and deployment pipelines, **we eliminate the need for you to provision or manage inference infrastructure entirely.** Instead, our systems execute your uploaded model directly in optimized runtime containers and expose it via a standard API interface.

You don’t deploy with Inferatech — you **run** with us.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Upload Your Model**  
   Push your model artifacts to our secure interface using supported formats (`.pt`, `.pth`, `.bin`, or `.gguf`). Your model is securely sandboxed in our stateless execution environment.

2. **Receive an API Key**  
   Each successful upload triggers a background validation job and, upon success, an API key is generated. This key scopes your access and metering.

3. **Invoke Inference via API**  
   Use our endpoint to call your model using standard RESTful or stream interfaces. All requests are token-billed, with real-time usage metering and analytics.

4. **Monitor and Iterate**  
   Access low-level logs, latency benchmarks, and token usage from your developer dashboard. Upgrade or replace models at any time — no downtime.

## 🚀 Why Inferatech?

- **No deployment, no containers, no DevOps.**  
  Just your model and our compute — that's it.

- **Precision Token Metering.**  
  You only pay for what you infer. No idle costs, no provisioning fees.

- **Upload once, scale instantly.**  
  All inference is executed in cold-start optimized runners with parallel queue execution and secure teardown after use.

- **Custom model support.**  
  Our system is format-agnostic. Any LLM you’ve fine-tuned or pre-trained locally can be executed.

- **ML engineer focused.**  
  Our clients aren’t casual — they’re technically advanced. We expose configuration toggles for performance tuning, backend memory strategy, and prompt routing.

## 📁 Supported Model Formats

Inferatech currently supports the following model formats for upload:

| Framework      | File Extensions         | Notes                                     |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| PyTorch        | `.pt`, `.pth`           | Standard torch save formats supported     |
| Transformers   | `.bin`, `safetensors`   | HuggingFace-compatible weights accepted   |
| GGML/GGUF      | `.gguf`, `.ggml`        | For quantized LLMs optimized for CPU use  |
| ONNX (beta)    | `.onnx`                 | For transformer-to-ONNX conversion        |

Model file size is currently capped at **8GB uncompressed**.

## 🔑 Inference API Usage

After model registration and approval, an API key is issued. This key is used to authenticate requests and track usage.

### Base Endpoint
```
POST https://api.inferatech.io/v1/infer
```

### Request Format
```json
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
  "model_id": "YOUR_MODEL_ID_HERE",
  "prompt": "What is the capital of Norway?",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "max_tokens": 200
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "completion": "The capital of Norway is Oslo.",
  "tokens_used": 11,
  "latency_ms": 421
}
```

### Notes
- Requests are billed per token (prompt + completion).
- Requests without a valid API key will fail with a `403 Forbidden`.
- Token latency is logged in sub-millisecond precision.
- Parallel request queuing is enabled by default.

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Private model testing**  
  Run inference on internal LLMs without worrying about VM orchestration.

- **Enterprise fine-tune delivery**  
  Clients can use your custom-trained LLMs through a metered interface without exposing your infrastructure.

- **Sandboxing evals**  
  Quickly evaluate multiple LLMs on the same prompts for output quality, latency, and cost comparisons.

---

## 📊 Billing & Metering

All inference is billed **per token**, with transparent logs accessible via your dashboard. Pricing varies by model size and runtime duration but always follows these principles:

- You only pay for **tokens processed**, not model size.
- **Idle time is free** — if you're not inferring, you're not paying.
- There are no hidden deployment, hosting, or storage fees.

Token billing is handled via our secure [Billing Portal](https://inferatech.ai/billing), with downloadable receipts and real-time usage graphs.

---

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

- Models are sandboxed on upload and auto-deleted after a maximum of 7 days without invocation.
- We never persist raw prompts or completions unless logging is explicitly enabled.
- No model data leaves our compute cluster at any time — zero egress by default.

## 🧭 Architecture Overview

```plaintext
User
 └── uploads model ➝ inferatech.io/upload
        └── model validation + container runtime provisioning
               └── secure API key issued
                      └── token-billed REST API access
                             └── isolated sandbox teardown after request
```

Inferatech is not a hosting provider. We are a **stateless execution layer** for private LLMs.
